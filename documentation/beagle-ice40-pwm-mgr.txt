iCE40 PWM FPGA controller

Required properties:
  - compatible: should be:
    - "beagle,ice40-pwm"
  - reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
  - #pwm-cells: Should be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a
    description of the cells format.

Examples:
        pwm-ice40 {
		compatible = "beagle,ice40-pwm";
		reg = <0x1000000 0x2000>;
		#pwm-cells = <>;
	}
