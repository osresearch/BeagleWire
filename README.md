<h1>BeagleWire</h1>
This repository contains software for BeagleWire. It is a realization of my project for GSOC-2017.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The task is to create software support for BeagleWire (based on iCE40 device). The completed project will provide the BeagleBoard.org community with easy to implement and powerful tools for realization of projects based on Programmable Logic Device(FPGA), which will surely increase the number of applications based on it. The developed software will be an easy and, at the same time, efficient tool for communication with FPGA. At this point FPGA will be able to meet the requirements of even more advanced applications. The BeagleWire creates a powerful and versatile digital cape for users to create their imaginative digital designs. 

<h2>About BeagleWire cape</h2>
The BeagleWire is an FPGA development platform that has been designed for use with BeagleBone boards. BeagleWire is a cape on which there is FPGA device - Lattice iCE40HX. The Lattice iCE40 is a family of FPGAs with a minimalistic architecture and very regular structure, designed for low-cost, high-volume consumer and system applications. The significance of FPGAs is continuously increasing, as they are more and more often used for supporting work of ARM processors. BeagleWire does not require external tools (JTAG) and the whole software is Open Source. iCE40 is an energy saving device, allowing to work with small batteries. FPGA cape allows easy and low cost start for beginners who would like to take their first steps in working with FPGAs.
